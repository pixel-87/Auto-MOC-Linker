# Auto-MOC-Linker

Automatically link tagged files to your Map of Content (MOC)

An Obsidian plugin that adds files to a MOC based on a specific tag defined by the user. Users can configure the tag in the plugin settings, and any file containing this tag will automatically be added to the designated MOC.

This plugin is in development. Although it only modifies MOC files, it is always a good practice to maintain backups of your notes.
