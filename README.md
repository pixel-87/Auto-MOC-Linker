# Auto-MOC-Linker

Automatically link tagged files to your Map of Content (MOC)

An Obsidian plugin that adds files to a MOC based on a specific tag defined by the user. Users can configure the tag in the plugin settings, and any file containing this tag will automatically be added to the designated MOC.

This plugin is in development. Although it only modifies MOC files, it is always a good practice to maintain backups of your notes.

## How to use
- Create a new mapping in the setting of the plugin. 

- Add a tag to the left hand box, with or without the starting #.
- Add the path to the MOC note, without .md extension.
- In the MOC note, create a heading for the links to be added under. Defaults to ## Links but can be changed in the settings under Section Heading.
- Run the command Auto MOC Linker.
